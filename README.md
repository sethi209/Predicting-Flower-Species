# Flower Species Prediction using XGBoost
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates how to predict the species of flowers based on the sizes of their petals. The analysis is performed using the Iris dataset, and the XGBoost algorithm is used for the machine learning analysis. The sklearn library is used to prepare the data and train the XGBoost model.

# Getting Started
To run the notebook, you will need to install the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
xgboost

# Data
The Iris dataset contains information about different species of flowers, including the sizes of their petals and sepals. The goal of the analysis is to predict the species of a flower based on the sizes of its petals.

# Approach
The analysis is performed using the following steps:

Load the data from the Iris dataset and perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
Prepare the data for analysis by encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and test sets.
Train an XGBoost model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.
Tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model using grid search and cross-validation.
Use the tuned XGBoost model to make predictions on new data.

# Results
The analysis shows that it is possible to predict the species of a flower based on the sizes of its petals with high accuracy using XGBoost. The tuned XGBoost model has an accuracy of 0.98 on the test data, indicating that it can correctly predict the species of a flower for 98% of the cases.

# Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates how to predict the species of flowers using XGBoost algorithm in Python and sklearn library. It shows that it is possible to predict the species of flowers with high accuracy using machine learning. However, further improvements can be made by using other models or including additional variables in the analysis.
